# Dotenv

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/pietvanzoen/deno-dotenv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/pietvanzoen/deno-dotenv)

Dotenv handling for deno.

### Rules

The parsing engine currently supports the following rules:

- `BASIC=basic` becomes `{BASIC: 'basic'}`
- empty lines are skipped
- lines beginning with `#` are treated as comments
- empty values become empty strings (`EMPTY=` becomes `{EMPTY: ''}`)
- single and double quoted values are escaped (`SINGLE_QUOTE='quoted'` becomes `{SINGLE_QUOTE: "quoted"}`)
- new lines are expanded if in double quotes (`MULTILINE="new\nline"` becomes

```
{MULTILINE: 'new
line'}
```

- inner quotes are maintained (think JSON) (`JSON={"foo": "bar"}` becomes `{JSON:"{\"foo\": \"bar\"}"`)
- whitespace is removed from both ends of the value (see more on [`trim`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/Trim)) (`FOO=" some value "` becomes `{FOO: 'some value'}`)
